### Deck Goals
* Sustain powerful friends through means of placing cards on top of your deck and drawing cards
* Control and Remove big threats to the deck
* Go through your deck as fast as possible to find the combo peices.

### Comboes
* [Mayor Mare][mayor] or [Moondancer][moondancer] with Meticulous X or [Starswirl Research][ssr]
* [Babs Seed][babs] with any form of draw, mainly [Let's Get This Party Started][lgtps]
* [Scope Things Out][scope] is a great enabler for [Babs][babs], [Moodnancer][moondancer], and [Mayor Mare][mayor].

### Entry
* [Babs Seed][babs] takes care of Pink entry for me. She's under-curve the turn she enters play (2 power for 3 AT), but she more than makes up for it later on. Pink being a splash for some tech cards later on needs no more entry than the 3 babs provides.
* [Mayor Mare][mayor] and [Owlowliscious][owl] takes care of my Purple entry seeing as purple is the main colour of the deck and the colour on which this strategy revolves around. [Mayor Mare][mayor] is there as a turn 1 play, and a way to start me on my way to my combo. [Owlowliscious][owl] is useful in that he's a 2-drop for no requirements that will also pump up your [Mayor Mares][mayor] and [Moondancers][moondancer].

### Lines of Play
Here are some good lines of play to use in game. They generally function to serve the combo and make use of the combo.

* Opener
	1. Play [Mayor Mare][mayor] to the lowest requirement on a problem. Leave 1 AT for next turn.
	2. Play [Moondancer][moondancer] to the other more hefty requirement on a problem. Then at the end of your opponent's turn play [Starswirl Research][ssr], [Twilight][bmane] flips.
	3. Use [Twilight's][bmane] Meticulous 1 and put the card ([Starswirl Research][ssr]) on top of your deck [Mayor Mare][mayor] and [Moondancer][moondancer] get +1 and +2 respectively. Play a second [Mayor Mare][mayor] to the same problem as the first, if you have none in hand play a 2-drop (preferably [Owlowliscious][owl]). You can then score 1 point, or 2 and force a DFO. Using [Starswirl][ssr] is optional here.

* Upkeep Boost *(Needs: [Starswirl Research][ssr] in hand or on top of your deck, [Spell Showdown][spell_showdown] as your active problem)*
	1. If [Starswirl Research][ssr] is in your hand, put it on top of your deck before the beginning of turn triggers fire.
	2. Trigger [Spell Showdown][spell_showdown] and reveal [Starswirl Research][ssr] giving them no information. Put it into your hand.
	3. Resolve your Meticulous triggers to buff, dig for an answer, or prepare for your next turn.
	4. **Optional:** Replay [Starswirl Research][ssr] before you draw your card for an extra buff to your purple combo peices.
	5. You now have a big set of buffs all for 0 AT.

* Fully Stacked *(Needs: 1 AT, [Scope Things Out][scope]. Benefits from [Spell Showdown][spell_showdown], [Starswirl Research][ssr])*
	1. If [Starswirl Research][ssr] is in your hand, put it on top of your deck before the beginning of turn triggers fire.
	2. Pay 1 AT to play [Scope Things Out][scope]
		* If you have dead cards in hand you want to cycle away and have enough Meticulous to cycle them to the bottom, place those cards further up on the deck.
		* If you have [Spell Showdown][spell_showdown] put an event on the top of your deck, or the first card under the dead cards being cycled away.
		* Then stack your deck for maybe desirable Chaos effects (at least 2 cards down) and leave a card you want to draw on top.
	3. After [Scope Things Out][scope] resolves [your mane][bmane] will have been flipped. You resolve your Meticulous in accordance with the previous list.
