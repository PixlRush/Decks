	<h3>Deck Goals</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>Sustain powerful friends through means of placing cards on top of your deck and drawing cards</li>
	<li>Control and Remove big threats to the deck</li>
	<li>Go through your deck as fast as possible to find the combo peices.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Comboes</h3>

	<ul>
	<li><a href="./card_images/EO/54.jpg">Mayor Mare</a> or <a href="./card_images/HM/36.jpg">Moondancer</a> with Meticulous X or <a href="./card_images/HM/95.jpg">Starswirl Research</a></li>
	<li><a href="./card_images/EO/36.jpg">Babs Seed</a> with any form of draw, mainly <a href="./card_images/PR/114.jpg">Let's Get This Party Started</a></li>
	<li><a href="./card_images/EO/136.jpg">Scope Things Out</a> is a great enabler for <a href="./card_images/EO/36.jpg">Babs</a>, <a href="./card_images/HM/36.jpg">Moodnancer</a>, and <a href="./card_images/EO/54.jpg">Mayor Mare</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Entry</h3>

	<ul>
	<li><a href="./card_images/EO/36.jpg">Babs Seed</a> takes care of Pink entry for me. She's under-curve the turn she enters play (2 power for 3 AT), but she more than makes up for it later on. Pink being a splash for some tech cards later on needs no more entry than the 3 babs provides.</li>
	<li><a href="./card_images/EO/54.jpg">Mayor Mare</a> and <a href="./card_images/HM/37.jpg">Owlowliscious</a> takes care of my Purple entry seeing as purple is the main colour of the deck and the colour on which this strategy revolves around. <a href="./card_images/EO/54.jpg">Mayor Mare</a> is there as a turn 1 play, and a way to start me on my way to my combo. <a href="./card_images/HM/37.jpg">Owlowliscious</a> is useful in that he's a 2-drop for no requirements that will also pump up your <a href="./card_images/EO/54.jpg">Mayor Mares</a> and <a href="./card_images/HM/36.jpg">Moondancers</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Lines of Play</h3>

	<p>Here are some good lines of play to use in game. They generally function to serve the combo and make use of the combo.</p>

	<ul>
	<li><p>Opener</p>

	<ol>
	<li>Play <a href="./card_images/EO/54.jpg">Mayor Mare</a> to the lowest requirement on a problem. Leave 1 AT for next turn.</li>
	<li>Play <a href="./card_images/HM/36.jpg">Moondancer</a> to the other more hefty requirement on a problem. Then at the end of your opponent's turn play <a href="./card_images/HM/95.jpg">Starswirl Research</a>, <a href="./card_images/EO/5b.jpg">Twilight</a> flips.</li>
	<li>Use <a href="./card_images/EO/5b.jpg">Twilight's</a> Meticulous 1 and put the card (<a href="./card_images/HM/95.jpg">Starswirl Research</a>) on top of your deck <a href="./card_images/EO/54.jpg">Mayor Mare</a> and <a href="./card_images/HM/36.jpg">Moondancer</a> get +1 and +2 respectively. Play a second <a href="./card_images/EO/54.jpg">Mayor Mare</a> to the same problem as the first, if you have none in hand play a 2-drop (preferably <a href="./card_images/HM/37.jpg">Owlowliscious</a>). You can then score 1 point, or 2 and force a DFO. Using <a href="./card_images/HM/95.jpg">Starswirl</a> is optional here.</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li><p>Upkeep Boost <em>(Needs: <a href="./card_images/HM/95.jpg">Starswirl Research</a> in hand or on top of your deck, <a href="./card_images/EO/196.jpg">Spell Showdown</a> as your active problem)</em></p>

	<ol>
	<li>If <a href="./card_images/HM/95.jpg">Starswirl Research</a> is in your hand, put it on top of your deck before the beginning of turn triggers fire.</li>
	<li>Trigger <a href="./card_images/EO/196.jpg">Spell Showdown</a> and reveal <a href="./card_images/HM/95.jpg">Starswirl Research</a> giving them no information. Put it into your hand.</li>
	<li>Resolve your Meticulous triggers to buff, dig for an answer, or prepare for your next turn.</li>
	<li><strong>Optional:</strong> Replay <a href="./card_images/HM/95.jpg">Starswirl Research</a> before you draw your card for an extra buff to your purple combo peices.</li>
	<li>You now have a big set of buffs all for 0 AT.</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li><p>Fully Stacked <em>(Needs: 1 AT, <a href="./card_images/EO/136.jpg">Scope Things Out</a>. Benefits from <a href="./card_images/EO/196.jpg">Spell Showdown</a>, <a href="./card_images/HM/95.jpg">Starswirl Research</a>)</em></p>

	<ol>
	<li>If <a href="./card_images/HM/95.jpg">Starswirl Research</a> is in your hand, put it on top of your deck before the beginning of turn triggers fire.</li>
	<li>Pay 1 AT to play <a href="./card_images/EO/136.jpg">Scope Things Out</a>
	<ul>
	<li>If you have dead cards in hand you want to cycle away and have enough Meticulous to cycle them to the bottom, place those cards further up on the deck.</li>
	<li>If you have <a href="./card_images/EO/196.jpg">Spell Showdown</a> put an event on the top of your deck, or the first card under the dead cards being cycled away.</li>
	<li>Then stack your deck for maybe desirable Chaos effects (at least 2 cards down) and leave a card you want to draw on top.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>After <a href="./card_images/EO/136.jpg">Scope Things Out</a> resolves <a href="./card_images/EO/5b.jpg">your mane</a> will have been flipped. You resolve your Meticulous in accordance with the previous list.</li>
	</ol></li>
	</ul>
